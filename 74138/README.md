# 74138
These circuits  are  designed  to  be  usedin   high-performance   memory-decoding   or   data-routingapplications,  requiring  very  short  propagation  delay  times.In high-performance memory systems these decoders canbe used to minimize the effects of system decoding. Whenused  with  high-speed  memories,  the  delay  times  of  thesedecoders  are  usually  less  than  the  typical  access  time  ofthe  memory.  This  means  that  the  effective  system  delayintroduced by the decoder is negligible.
The  DM74LS138  decodes  one-of-eight  lines,  based  upon the  conditions  at  the  three  binary  select  inputs  and  the three  enable  inputs.  Two  active-low  and  one  active-high enable inputs reduce the need for external gates or inverters  when  expanding. An enable input can be used as a data input for demultiplexing applications.
